NoDent
======

NoDent is a small module for Nodejs that implements the JavaScript ES7 keywords `async` and `await`. These make writing, reading and understanding asynchronous and callback methods more implicit and embedded in the language. It works by (optionally) transforming JavaScript when it is loaded into Node.

This is the core compiler implementation. The main documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent)
